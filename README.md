# SmartBuildings_EnergyControl
 
In this project we developed different stochastic, as well as, deterministic RL algorithms with variable transition periods (based on SMDPs rather than MDPs) and applied them to the problem of micro-climate control in smart buildings. The developed RL agents learn how to operate smart thermostats so as to improve energy consumption as well as the occupants’ comfort.

There are 4 main Jupyter Notebook files:

1)	SmartBuildings_EnergyControl_Main.ipynb: This is the main file to run.
2)	Environment.ipynb: This is the class file that contains our developed environment classes for the building.
3)	ReinforcementLearning.ipynb: This is the class file that contains our developed RL algorithms. 
4)	Training.ipynb: This is the file that contains different training functions required for our algorithms in the RL class
